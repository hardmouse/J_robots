TurtleBot_2DOF
==============

This is an Arduino based quadruped.

This is Jay Yu, the guy with no programming background but passionate to play and build these robots.
Thanks to the technology nowadays that everything become so simple to build. On the other hand; it's more confusing since there are more new comer out there to generate strange code like this.

The only reason I post it here because some people are asking about it. So, here we go.

All model files(*.stl) for this 3D printed quadreped can be found from:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:152638

I have used 9G micro servos, arduino UNO or other compatible board, Servo shield, 7.2V lipo battery with 5A UBEC for power source and one ultrasonic sensor SR04.

Sorry for poor English and very rough documents and instrusctions for this project but use more of your creativity to improve your quadruped.

This program is still under development and again; I am not even a programmer so you can find many weird or incorrect methods to operate this robot.

However, hope you enjoy it and don't curse if you running into any trouble when using this program. :p
